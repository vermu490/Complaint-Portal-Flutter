# Compliant-Portal-Flutter

In this project I have developed an Android Application  using Flutter framework 
which helps the user to generate a complaint to management and management is allowed to go through
the complaint and perform necessary actions to resolve the complaint. This application will have the
following features:

● Users should be able to register the application using their name and email address.

● Users should be able to submit a complaint to management. A complaint will consist of a
Complaint Title, Summary and severity of the complaint.

● Users should be able to see the list of all the submitted complaints with a tag that denotes if the
complaint is resolved or not.

● Administrator should be able to view all the complaints that have been submitted on the portal.
This will contain the title of the complaint and name of the user.

● Administrator should be able to view any particular complaint and review it. Administrators can
mark it as resolved whenever they feel appropriate.

● Once the complaint is resolved, users should be able to see their complaints marked as resolved.

● Any user can perform any of the above actions except registration only when logged in and if the
user has appropriate permissions.
